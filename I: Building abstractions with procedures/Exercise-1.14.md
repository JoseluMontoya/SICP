Since the longest branch will be the one with `(cc n 1)` on it, it's length from that node will be `n`, and on top of it will always be 4 nodes (`(cc n 5)`, `(cc n 4)`,  `(cc n 3)` and `(cc n 2)`), the order of growth of space of the process will be $\\Theta(n)$.

To obtain the order of growth of number of steps, where going to need to analize how the number of steps varies with the number of types of coins used. First, let's see the tree generated for the procedure `(cc n 1)`

As we can see, the number of steps is $2n + 1$ (one at the top plus $n$ rows with 2 steps each), so his order of growth of number of steps will be $\\Theta(n)$. Now, let's check the tree generated by `(cc n 2)`.

Now, we have $n/5$ rounded down (so $\lfloor n/5 \rfloor$) steps that generate proceses with a order of growth of number of steps equal to $\\Theta(n)$ plus the one at the end, which means that the order of growth of number of steps for `(cc n 2)` is $\\lfloor n/5 \rfloor \left(\Theta(n)\right) + 1 = \Theta(n^2)$

If we keep repeating this, is easy to see that for a process `(cc n k)`, the order of growth of number of steps is $\Theta(n^k)$, and for our specific case, that is $\Theta(n^5)$
