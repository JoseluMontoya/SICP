Prove that $\text{Fib}(n)$ is the closest integer to $\phi^n/\sqrt{5}$, where
$\phi = (1 + \sqrt{5})/2$. Hint: Let $\psi = (1 − \sqrt{5})/2$. Use induction
and the definition of the Fibonacci numbers (see Section 1.2.2) to prove that
$\text{Fib}(n) = (\phi^n − \psi^n )/\sqrt{5}$.

First, as the hint says, prove by induction the following formula

$$
\text{Fib}(n) = (\phi^n − \psi^n )/\sqrt{5}
$$

with $\phi = (1 + \sqrt{5})/2$ and $\psi = (1 − \sqrt{5})/2$.

1. We check for $n = 1$

$$
\text{Fib}(n = 1) = (\phi^1 − \psi^1 )/\sqrt{5}
                  = (1 + \sqrt{5} - 1 + \sqrt{5})/2\sqrt{5}
                  = 2\sqrt{5}/2\sqrt{5} = 1
$$


2. We apply the inductive hypothesis, in which we state that the expression
   holds true up to $n$


3. We check for $n + 1$

$$
\text{Fib}(n+1) = (\phi^{n+1} − \psi^{n+1} )/\sqrt{5}
$$

Since $\text{Fib}(n+1) = \text{Fib}(n) + \text{Fib}(n-1)$, were going to
develop this expression and see if it leads us to the one were trying to
prove.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Fib}(n+1) = \text{Fib}(n) + \text{Fib}(n-1)
                &= (\phi^n − \psi^n )/\sqrt{5} +
                   (\phi^{n-1} − \psi^{n-1} )/\sqrt{5}\\
                &= (\phi^n + \phi^{n-1} −
                   (\psi^n + \psi^{n-1}))/\sqrt{5}\\
                &= (((1 + \phi^{-1})/\phi)\phi^{n+1} −
                    ((1 + \psi^{-1})/\psi)\psi^{n+1} )/\sqrt{5}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

And because $((1 + \phi^{-1})/\phi) = ((1 + \psi^{-1})/\psi) = 1$, the
expression for $\text{Fib}(b)$ is proven.

Now, to prove that $\text{Fib}(n)$ is the closest integer to
$\phi^n/\sqrt{5}$, what were going to do is to prove that
$\left|\psi^n\right|/\sqrt{5} < 0.5$ for any $n$.

$$
f(n = 1) = \left|\phi^1\rigth|/\sqrt{5} = 0.27
$$

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial n} f(n) =
\frac{\partial}{\partial n} \left|\phi^n\rigth|/\sqrt{5} =
\frac{\partial}{\partial n} (-\phi)^n/\sqrt{5} =
(-\phi)^n/\sqrt{5} \ln{(-\phi)} < 0
$$

Which means that $f(n) < 0.5$, and proves that $\text{Fib}(n)$ is the
closes integer to $\phi^n/\sqrt{5}$.
