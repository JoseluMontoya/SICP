    Modify =fixed-point= so that it prints the sequence of approximations it
    generates, using the =newline= and =display= primitives shown in Exercise 1.22. Then
    find a solution to $x^x = 1000$ by finding a fixed point of $x \mapsto
    \log(1000)/ \log(x)$. (Use Schemeâ€™s primitive =log= procedure, which computes
    natural logarithms.) Compare the number of steps this takes with and without
    average damping. (Note that you cannot start =fixed-point= with a guess of 1, as
    this would cause division by $\log(1) = 0$.)

```scheme :session,"1.36"
(define tolerance 0.00001)
(define (fixed-point f first-guess)
  (define (close-enough? v1 v2)
    (< (abs (- v1 v2))
       tolerance))
  (define (try guess)
    (let ((next (f guess)))
      (display next)
      (newline)
      (if (close-enough? guess next)
          next
          (try next))))
  (try first-guess))
```

: #&lt;void>

Without average damping, the procedure is

```scheme :session,"1.36"
(fixed-point (lambda (x) (/ (log 1000) (log x))) 2.0)
```

and it takes 35 steps.

With average damping, the procedure is

```scheme :session,"1.36"
(fixed-point (lambda (x) (/ (+ x (/ (log 1000) (log x))) 2)) 2.0)
```

and it takes 10 steps
