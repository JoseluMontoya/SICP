    Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive
    integers in terms of the procedures inc, which increments its argument by 1,
    and dec, which decrements its argument by 1.

    #+begin_src scheme
    (define (+ a b)
      (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
    (define (+ a b)
      (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
    #+end_src

    Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each
    procedure in evaluating =(+ 4 5)=. Are these processes iterative or recursive?

Let's take as an example `(+ 3 4)`

The first procedure would expand in the following way

```scheme 
(+ 3 4)
(inc (+ 2 4))
(inc (inc (+ 1 4)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 0 4))))
(inc (inc (inc 4)))
(inc (inc 5))
(inc 6)
7
```

And the second one as such

```scheme 
(+ 3 4)
(+ 2 5)
(+ 1 6)
(+ 0 7)
7
```

As we can see, the process of the first procedure is recursve, while the process of the second one is iterative.
