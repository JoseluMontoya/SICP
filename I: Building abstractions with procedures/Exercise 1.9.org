#+begin_quote
Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive
integers in terms of the procedures inc, which increments its argument by 1,
and dec, which decrements its argument by 1.
#+end_quote
#+begin_src scheme
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
#+end_src
#+begin_quote
Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each
procedure in evaluating =(+ 4 5)=. Are these processes iterative or recursive?
#+end_quote

Let's take as an example =(+ 3 4)=

The first procedure would expand in the following way
#+begin_src scheme
(+ 3 4)
(inc (+ 2 4))
(inc (inc (+ 1 4)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 0 4))))
(inc (inc (inc 4)))
(inc (inc 5))
(inc 6)
7
#+end_src

And the second one as such
#+begin_src scheme
(+ 3 4)
(+ 2 5)
(+ 1 6)
(+ 0 7)
7
#+end_src

As we can see, the process of the first procedure is iterative, while the
process of the second one is recursive.
