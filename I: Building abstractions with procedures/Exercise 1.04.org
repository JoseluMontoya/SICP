#+begin_quote
Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are
compound expres- sions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the
following procedure:
#+end_quote
#+begin_src scheme
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
#+end_src

What the procedure is going to do is the following:
- If =b= is greater than 0, then the =if= statement is going to return the
  operator =+=
- If 0 is greater than =b=, then the =if= statement is going to return the
  operator =-=
This way, the procedure will do what his name implies: sum =a= and the
absolute value of =b=
