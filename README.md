This is my attempt to resolve all the problems of Structure and interpretation
of Computer Programs, by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman. Each folder
with a roman number on it will contain all the exercises of that chapter,
written in an org file, with babel block contatining the necesaary code.

Due to the crappy implementation of LaTeX rendering in Github, some exercises
won't look right. I don't care. I prefer to have correct org mode files that
can be exported to pdf, than to try to make it look ok only here. When the
whole book is completed, I'll complile all documents into a single pdf to make
it easy to read.
